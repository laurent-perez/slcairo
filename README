This is a S-Lang [1] module for cairo [2]
Part of the module is generated using SLIRP [3] and some functions are
wrapped by hands.

INSTALL
There is no configure script yet. You may have to modify the makefile
according to your system. After issuing '.gencode' and 'make'
commands, copy the resulting 'cairo-module.so' where other slang
modules are installed (/usr/lib64/slang/v2/modules) and 'cairo.sl' to
local packages directory (/usr/share/slsh/local-packages).

DOC
You should be able to use this module reading detailled cairo
documentation and S-Lang scripts provided in examples directory.
